FogBugz Project Dashboard
=========================

#### See how your project is really doing.


Using this Web App, easily find out:

* Where the project is according to original timeline, how many work days already passed and remaining
* Which tasks have been estimated and which havenâ€™t been, by whole project and each developer
* Which of the developers will be on time, and which are behind
* Status of QA, how many tasks left to test, how much time left? Is it enough to finish under deadline
